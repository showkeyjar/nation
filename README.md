This is a open source project for create a nation or country.

it's just a blue plan, I hope that one day the project can be true.

## Why create open source Nation?

because, there is no country can open their constitution and laws to everyone, and no country can make every citizen satisfied.

so, I hope we can create an open source nation project for everybody that have same live values.

Nation is a open project that everyone can push their ideas to constitution and laws for the perfect state.
