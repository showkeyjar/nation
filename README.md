# Nation

open nation for everyone

This is a open source project for create a nation or country.

it's just a blue plan, I hope that one day the project can be true.

## Why create open source Nation?

because, there is no country can open their constitution and laws to everyone, 

and many laws has no reason but for the ruling class, 

and no country can make every citizen satisfied.

so, I hope we can create an open source nation project for everybody that have same live values.

## What's Nation?

Nation is a open project that everyone can push their ideas to constitution and laws for the perfect state.

Every line of law must well-founded: vote or data science to verify.

And the designers can not be vested interests.

Judgment on the nature of monopoly: Once it is determined that it is a monopoly, open source will be carried out, so that the basic capabilities of human beings will accumulate and progress. Otherwise, once the monopoly falls, everything will have to start from scratch without accumulation.

The so-called capital or communism is only a tool to realize the collective wisdom or progress of the society, and there is no need to form a hostile ideology. The overall goal is to stimulate people's initiative and serve the society.

## How to use?

I have no idea now, maybe one day in feature, we can deploy it to a neutral country or place on earth or other plant?
