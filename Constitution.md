# Constitution

this is a first open source constitution! 

have fun!


## 1. Development Law

  Human develop their technology to make life better, so I suggest development law for the first rule of Constitution.

  rule 1: People can develop any technology to earn money that has benefit for legitimate use.

  rule 2: If a technology has been market monopoly, then the nation has right to let this technology open source, and repricing it. We can call it nationalized.

  rule 3: If a technology is nationalized, others people can not use it to earn money. 

  rule 4: If a technology is nationalized, the nation obliged to serve it to everyone.

  ### why?

  because unified service is good for human society progress, and monopoly hinders progress, we can use state apparatus to avoid it. In the case of monopoly, unnecessary new competition leads to waste of human resources.

  ### how to protect the creative spirit?

  the repricing technology not only has cost, but also has profit, the nation can decide proportion of allocation to creator.
